## Introduction

A smart community should be a platform-independent universal standard, built upon the Internet of Everything protocol, forming a (de)centralized hybrid computing network.

The development of technology is not to enslave everything, but to enable every member to live with dignity and equality.

## Example

Here, we use Mijia (Xiaomi, please sponsor us) as an example to illustrate the minimal case of a smart home.

```LLM
Zeusro: Xiao Ai.
Xiao Ai: Yes.
Zeusro: Turn on the light.
Xiao Ai: Sure.
```

As shown above, with the support of the IoT platform behind the Xiaomi smart speaker, basic human language is converted into machine language, and finally executed on the smart light bulb.

This LLM process is essentially a statistical learning mapping, "translating" human language into other languages (or task mappings).

## Concepts

### IoT

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, each with a universally unique identifier (UUID), and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

### Smart Community

A smart community refers to the integrated application of new-generation information technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, and mobile internet, providing residents with a safe, comfortable, and convenient modern intelligent living environment. It forms a new type of community management based on informatization and intelligent social management and services.

### Large Language Model

Large Language Model, abbreviated as LLM.

### Intelligent Unit

An intelligent unit is the general form of the smallest smart home network.
In the light switch example above, you can even remove the bulb and just let the Xiaomi speaker play music, forming an even smaller intelligent unit.

However, as of now (2025), smart terminals and (de)centralized networks are fundamental components that cannot be avoided.

### Centralized Network

The current global network system is built based on root domain name servers.

### Decentralized Network

Also called edge networks. In the context of digital homes, it can be simply understood as the home wireless network (which connects to the centralized network and includes a local area network).

### Smart Terminal

A smart terminal is the entry point for triggering device scheduling commands. For example, smart speakers (Xiaomi Speaker, Tmall Genie, Apple HomePod, etc.), (Android/Apple) smartphones, smart wristbands, and so on.

These smart terminals can effectively receive user commands and, through remote LLM or local input parsing, convert them into general basic commands.

### Voice Assistant

A voice assistant refers to software based on LLM, or the "ghost" that "inhabits" smart terminals. Examples include Alexa, Tmall Genie, Xiao Ai, etc.

### Digital Home

Based on residential spaces, the digital home leverages IoT, cloud computing, big data, mobile communications, artificial intelligence, and other new-generation information technologies to realize interconnection and interoperability of system platforms and home products, meeting users' needs for information access and digital home life services.

### Digital Home System Platform

Through information sharing and interoperability among various internal and external devices in the home, as well as functions such as data integration and application integration, the platform provides residents with comprehensive services including government, social, and smart home services in a safe and convenient manner.

### Smart Home Device

A home device with network communication capabilities that can self-describe, publish, and interact with other nodes.

Smart home devices can also be further divided into smart appliances, smart panels, etc.

Smart home appliances: 
These products are the result of integrating IoT technologies, microprocessors, sensors, and network communication technologies into home appliances. These devices possess intelligent identification, usage, or control management capabilities and can interact intelligently with control panels, touch screens, remote controls, and mobile apps.

Smart Panel:
A control panel with communication capabilities. The controlled devices may include lighting, air conditioning, or other devices or appliances.

### Smart Home Device Controller

Smart home devices are based on an offline design (physical circuit shutdown),
with periodic heartbeat reporting, and support for various control flows (program logic startup, shutdown, and control).

A collection of tools for operating smart home devices is called a smart home device controller.

### Smart Central Control Gateway

Connects smart home devices with external networks and digital home system platforms. It is capable of information collection, processing and analysis, protocol conversion, etc., enabling information sharing and interoperability among various devices inside and outside the home, and supports devices with multiple interaction methods. This includes standalone smart gateways or integrated devices merged with video intercom indoor units, home routers, smart speakers, etc.

### Digital Home Service Provider

Entities or organizations that provide products, platforms, or services related to digital homes.

### Room

Spaces within residential buildings where people spend extended periods, including living rooms, bedrooms, studies, etc.

## Overall Architecture Design Approach

Architectural design isn't about building something from scratch, nor is it about showmanship. Rather, it's about effectively organizing and continuously optimizing resources based on actual circumstances.

Thus, during the architectural design phase, the focus isn't on simply adopting the latest technology as much as possible.

Rather, we should first clarify concepts, organize and summarize them, and establish conceptual definitions through formal logic to prepare for subsequent iterations and upgrades.

## Hardware standards

Hardware standards are subject to specific local laws and regulations.

In addition to complying with these guidelines, smart home development must also comply with current national standards and regulations.

## Software Standards

Software standards are specialized in accordance with local laws and regulations.

## Protocol Fallback

Protocol fallback refers to a fault-tolerance mechanism implemented by smart homes when underlying dependent components are unavailable or the target user is mismatched.

For example, if a public cloud smart home system platform fails, assuming the public network is unavailable, can smart home devices be downgraded to a local area network solution, or can mesh technology or infrared technology be used to achieve offline device control?

If elderly users are unfamiliar with the operation of smart devices such as smart speakers, they can still operate the target device through traditional physical control methods (such as switch panels and remote controls).
